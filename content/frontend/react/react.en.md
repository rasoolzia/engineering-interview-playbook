## 🧠 Question 1

**ID**: react-001
**Title**: What is React and what problem does it solve?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: React Basics

### Answer 📄

React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta (Facebook) for building user interfaces, primarily single-page applications.

It addresses several core frontend challenges:

- **Keeping the UI in sync with state** — React makes the view a pure function of state. When state changes, React re-renders the relevant parts of the UI automatically.
- **Efficient DOM updates** — React uses a Virtual DOM to minimize expensive real DOM operations by computing the minimal set of changes needed.
- **Reusable UI components** — the component model lets developers compose complex UIs from small, isolated, and testable pieces.

React is intentionally focused only on the view layer. Routing, data fetching, and state management are handled by the surrounding ecosystem (React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand, Redux, etc.).

Because React is a library rather than a framework, it integrates easily into existing applications and gives teams full control over architectural decisions.

## 🧠 Question 2

**ID**: react-002
**Title**: What is the Virtual DOM and how does React use it?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: Rendering Behavior

### Answer 📄

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM tree. It is a plain JavaScript object tree that describes the UI structure.

When a component's state or props change, React:

1. **Renders** a new Virtual DOM tree by calling the component's render function.
2. **Diffs** the new tree against the previous one (reconciliation) to find what changed.
3. **Patches** only the changed nodes into the real DOM (commit phase).

This process is called **reconciliation** and it keeps DOM mutations minimal, because touching the real DOM is significantly more expensive than comparing JavaScript objects.

React does not re-render the whole page on every state change — only the subtree that depends on the changed state is re-evaluated.

```jsx
// When count changes, React re-renders Counter,
// computes the minimal DOM update, and applies only that.
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

**Important:** the VDOM is an implementation detail. React Native, for example, uses React's reconciler without a browser DOM at all.

## 🧠 Question 3

**ID**: react-003
**Title**: What is JSX and how does it work under the hood?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: JSX & Rendering

### Answer 📄

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like markup inside JavaScript. It is not valid JavaScript on its own — it must be compiled by a transpiler (Babel or the TypeScript compiler) before the browser can run it.

Each JSX element compiles to a `React.createElement()` call (classic runtime) or a `jsx()` call from `react/jsx-runtime` (automatic runtime, React 17+):

```jsx
// JSX
const element = <h1 className="title">Hello, {name}</h1>;

// Compiled (automatic runtime — React 17+)
import { jsx as _jsx } from 'react/jsx-runtime';
const element = _jsx('h1', { className: 'title', children: `Hello, ${name}` });
```

The result is a plain JavaScript object — a **React element** (vnode):

```js
{
  type: 'h1',
  props: { className: 'title', children: 'Hello, Alice' },
  key: null,
  ref: null,
}
```

**Key JSX rules:**

- A component must return a single root element (use `<>...</>` fragments for multiple roots).
- `class` becomes `className`; `for` becomes `htmlFor`.
- All tags must be closed: `<img />`, `<br />`.
- JavaScript expressions go inside `{}`.
- Component names must start with a capital letter to distinguish from HTML tags.

## 🧠 Question 4

**ID**: react-004
**Title**: What are functional components in React?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: Components

### Answer 📄

A functional component is a JavaScript function that accepts a `props` object and returns JSX (React elements). It is the standard way to write components in modern React.

```jsx
function Greeting({ name, role = 'user' }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Role: {role}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Arrow function syntax — equally valid
const Greeting = ({ name, role = 'user' }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
    <p>Role: {role}</p>
  </div>
);
```

Before React 16.8, functional components were "stateless" — state and lifecycle required class components. Hooks changed this: functional components can now use state (`useState`), side effects (`useEffect`), context, refs, and any custom hook.

**Why functional components are preferred:**

- Simpler mental model — no `this`, no lifecycle method naming conventions.
- Easier to test — pure functions are predictable.
- Better TypeScript inference.
- All React features (Concurrent Mode, Server Components) are designed around functions.

Class components still work but are no longer the recommended approach.

## 🧠 Question 5

**ID**: react-005
**Title**: What are props in React and how do they work?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: Props & State

### Answer 📄

Props (short for "properties") are the mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only — a component must never modify its own props.

```jsx
// Parent passes data via props
function App() {
  return <UserCard name="Alice" age={30} isAdmin={true} />;
}

// Child receives props as a plain object
function UserCard({ name, age, isAdmin }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      {isAdmin && <span>Admin</span>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Prop types:**

- Strings: `name="Alice"` (no braces needed)
- Anything else (numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, functions): `age={30}`
- Omitted boolean: `<Button disabled />` is equivalent to `disabled={true}`

**`children` prop** — content between opening and closing tags is passed as `props.children`:

```jsx
function Card({ children, title }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage
<Card title="Info">
  <p>Some content</p>
</Card>;
```

**Spreading props** — use the spread operator to forward all props:

```jsx
function Button({ className, ...rest }) {
  return <button className={`btn ${className}`} {...rest} />;
}
```

## 🧠 Question 6

**ID**: react-006
**Title**: What is state in React and how is it different from props?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: Props & State

### Answer 📄

State is mutable data managed within a component. When state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the new state. Unlike props (owned by the parent), state is owned and controlled by the component itself.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // initial value: 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c - 1)}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Props vs State:**

|                     | Props                        | State                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Owner               | Parent component             | The component itself     |
| Mutable?            | No (read-only)               | Yes (via setter)         |
| Triggers re-render? | Yes (when parent re-renders) | Yes (when setter called) |
| Passed via          | Function argument            | `useState` hook          |

**Functional update form** — pass a function to the setter when the new value depends on the previous value. This is essential for correctness inside async callbacks or batched updates:

```js
setCount((prev) => prev + 1); // safe — always reads latest value
setCount(count + 1); // potentially stale in concurrent mode
```

**State is local and encapsulated** — sibling components do not share state directly. To share state, lift it to the nearest common ancestor.

## 🧠 Question 7

**ID**: react-007
**Title**: How does React handle events?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: Forms & Events

### Answer 📄

React uses a **synthetic event system** that wraps the browser's native DOM events. React attaches a single event listener at the root of the React tree (not on each element), and dispatches events to the correct handlers through event delegation.

```jsx
function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // works just like native preventDefault
    console.log('submitted');
  }

  function handleChange(event) {
    console.log(event.target.value); // SyntheticEvent — same API as native
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input onChange={handleChange} />
    </form>
  );
}
```

**Key differences from native HTML events:**

- React event names are camelCase: `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit` (not `onclick`).
- You pass a function reference, not a string: `onClick={handleClick}` not `onclick="handleClick()"`.
- Synthetic events are pooled in older React (≤ 16) and reused — accessing them asynchronously required `event.persist()`. In React 17+ this pooling was removed.

**Event propagation** works the same as native events (bubbles, capture phase). You can stop propagation with `event.stopPropagation()`.

React 17 changed the root of event delegation from `document` to the React root container, which makes micro-frontend composition with multiple React versions safer.

## 🧠 Question 8

**ID**: react-008
**Title**: How does conditional rendering work in React?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: JSX & Rendering

### Answer 📄

React has no special template directives for conditionals — you use plain JavaScript expressions inside JSX.

**Ternary operator** — the most common pattern:

```jsx
function Alert({ type, message }) {
  return (
    <div className={`alert alert-${type}`}>
      {type === 'error' ? <ErrorIcon /> : <InfoIcon />}
      <span>{message}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Short-circuit `&&`** — renders the right side only when the left side is truthy:

```jsx
{
  isLoggedIn && <Dashboard />;
}
```

**Pitfall:** if the left side is `0`, React renders `0` in the DOM (because `0` is falsy but also a valid renderable value). Use `!!` or a ternary to be safe:

```jsx
{
  items.length > 0 && <List items={items} />;
} // safe — boolean
{
  items.length && <List items={items} />;
} // dangerous — renders "0" if empty
```

**Early return pattern:**

```jsx
function Profile({ user }) {
  if (!user) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

**`null` to render nothing:**

```jsx
function Banner({ visible, message }) {
  if (!visible) return null;
  return <div className="banner">{message}</div>;
}
```

## 🧠 Question 9

**ID**: react-009
**Title**: How do you render lists in React and why is the `key` prop important?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: JSX & Rendering

### Answer 📄

Lists in React are rendered by mapping over an array and returning JSX for each item. Each element in the list must have a unique `key` prop.

```jsx
function TodoList({ todos }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <li key={todo.id}>
          <span>{todo.text}</span>
          {todo.done && <span>✓</span>}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

**Why `key` matters:**

When React reconciles a list, it uses `key` to match elements between the previous and new render. Without stable keys, React falls back to index-based matching, which causes incorrect behavior when items are reordered, inserted, or deleted:

- Component state (like an input's typed value) gets attached to the wrong element.
- Unnecessary DOM mutations occur.
- Animations and focus are disrupted.

**Rules for keys:**

- Must be **unique among siblings** (not globally unique).
- Must be **stable** — the same item should have the same key across renders.
- Should be a **stable identifier** from your data (database ID, UUID). Avoid using array index unless the list is static and never reordered.

```jsx
// Bad — index as key breaks with sorting/filtering
{
  items.map((item, index) => <Item key={index} {...item} />);
}

// Good — stable ID from data
{
  items.map((item) => <Item key={item.id} {...item} />);
}
```

## 🧠 Question 10

**ID**: react-010
**Title**: What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: Forms & Events

### Answer 📄

**Controlled components** — form elements whose value is driven by React state. The component is the single source of truth, and every keystroke goes through a state update.

```jsx
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  return (
    <input
      value={value} // React controls the value
      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}
```

**Uncontrolled components** — form elements that manage their own internal state. React reads the value via a `ref` only when needed (e.g., on form submit).

```jsx
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleSubmit() {
    console.log(inputRef.current.value); // read on demand
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} defaultValue="initial" />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

**When to use each:**

|                                           | Controlled             | Uncontrolled            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Validation on every keystroke             | ✅ Natural             | ❌ Requires ref polling |
| Instant feedback (format, disable submit) | ✅                     | ❌                      |
| File inputs                               | ❌ Can't control value | ✅ Must use ref         |
| Simple forms, third-party integrations    | ❌ More boilerplate    | ✅ Less code            |

Most React forms use controlled components. Libraries like React Hook Form take a hybrid approach (uncontrolled under the hood for performance, controlled-like API for validation).

## 🧠 Question 11

**ID**: react-011
**Title**: What is a React Fragment and when should you use it?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: JSX & Rendering

### Answer 📄

A Fragment lets a component return multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node as a wrapper.

```jsx
// Without Fragment — adds an unnecessary <div>
function Columns() {
  return (
    <div>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>Age</td>
    </div>
  ); // invalid HTML — <div> inside <tr>
}

// With Fragment — no extra DOM node
function Columns() {
  return (
    <>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>Age</td>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Two syntaxes:**

```jsx
// Shorthand — cannot accept props
<>...</>;

// Explicit — required when you need a key (e.g., mapping a list)
function List({ items }) {
  return items.map((item) => (
    <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
      <dt>{item.term}</dt>
      <dd>{item.description}</dd>
    </React.Fragment>
  ));
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Returning multiple table cells (`<td>`) or rows (`<tr>`) from a component.
- Grouping elements returned from a component without polluting the DOM.
- Rendering a list where each item produces multiple sibling elements.

Fragments produce no DOM output, so they have no impact on styling or layout.

## 🧠 Question 12

**ID**: react-012
**Title**: What is the difference between class components and functional components?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: Components

### Answer 📄

Both types can produce the same output, but they differ significantly in syntax, API, and how they manage state and lifecycle.

**Class components** use ES6 classes, have `this`, lifecycle methods, and `this.state`:

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 };

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `Count: ${this.state.count}`;
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `Count: ${this.state.count}`;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.setState((s) => ({ count: s.count + 1 }))}>
        {this.state.count}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

**Functional components** use hooks:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  });

  return <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

**Key differences:**

|                       | Class Components               | Functional Components             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| State                 | `this.state` + `this.setState` | `useState`                        |
| Lifecycle             | `componentDidMount`, etc.      | `useEffect`                       |
| `this` binding        | Required                       | Not needed                        |
| Code reuse            | Mixins (problematic)           | Custom hooks (clean)              |
| Error boundaries      | Supported                      | Not yet (as of React 18)          |
| React future features | Not prioritized                | All new features target functions |

Class components are fully supported but are considered legacy. All new React APIs (Concurrent Mode, Server Components) are designed around functions.

## 🧠 Question 13

**ID**: react-013
**Title**: What is reconciliation in React?
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Category**: Rendering Behavior

### Answer 📄

Reconciliation is the process React uses to determine what changed in the UI between renders and update the DOM accordingly.

When state or props change, React calls the component's render function and gets a new virtual DOM tree. It then **diffs** this new tree against the previous one using a heuristic algorithm with two key assumptions:

1. **Different element types produce different trees.** If the root type changes (e.g., `<div>` → `<span>`), React tears down the entire old subtree and builds a new one from scratch — including unmounting all child components.

2. **`key` identifies stable elements across renders.** When diffing lists, React uses the `key` prop to match elements between renders. Elements with the same key are treated as the same element (updated in place); missing/new keys trigger unmount/mount.

```jsx
// React assumes the root element changed — unmounts Foo, mounts Bar
{
  condition ? <Foo /> : <Bar />;
}

// React sees same root type — updates Foo's props (more efficient)
{
  condition ? <Foo color="red" /> : <Foo color="blue" />;
}
```

**Why this matters for performance:** React's reconciler avoids expensive full-tree comparisons by applying these heuristics. The result is O(n) tree diffing rather than the naive O(n³) algorithm.

The reconciler is separate from the renderer. React DOM, React Native, and React Three Fiber all share the same reconciler but target different output environments.

## 🧠 Question 14

**ID**: react-014
**Title**: What is prop drilling and how do you solve it?
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Category**: Props & State

### Answer 📄

Prop drilling occurs when data must be passed through several layers of intermediate components that do not need the data themselves — they only pass it further down.

```jsx
// Prop drilling — theme must be threaded through App → Layout → Sidebar → Button
function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');
  return <Layout theme={theme} setTheme={setTheme} />;
}
function Layout({ theme, setTheme }) {
  return <Sidebar theme={theme} setTheme={setTheme} />;
}
function Sidebar({ theme, setTheme }) {
  return <ThemeButton theme={theme} setTheme={setTheme} />;
}
function ThemeButton({ theme, setTheme }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setTheme((t) => (t === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'))}>
      {theme}
    </button>
  );
}
```

**Problems it causes:**

- Intermediate components become tightly coupled to data they don't use.
- Refactoring is painful — adding a prop requires updating every layer.
- Components are harder to reuse in isolation.

**Solutions:**

1. **Context API** — provide data at a high level and consume it anywhere in the tree without threading:

```jsx
const ThemeContext = createContext('light');
// Wrap the tree: <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
// Consume anywhere: const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

2. **State management libraries** (Zustand, Redux, Jotai) — global store accessible from any component.

3. **Component composition** — pass components as children or props to avoid drilling data:

```jsx
function Layout({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
// The parent controls what goes inside, so no drilling needed
```

## 🧠 Question 15

**ID**: react-015
**Title**: What is the `StrictMode` component and what does it do?
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Category**: React Basics

### Answer 📄

`<React.StrictMode>` is a development-only wrapper that activates additional warnings and behaviors to help you identify potential issues in your application.

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

**What StrictMode does (development only — no production impact):**

1. **Double-invokes render functions, state initializers, and reducers** — to detect side effects in functions that should be pure. If your component has accidental side effects (e.g., incrementing a counter in render), they become visible.

2. **Mounts → unmounts → remounts every component once** (React 18+) — to verify that effects have proper cleanup. This simulates what happens when components are preserved/restored (e.g., navigating back in a React Native screen or future tab-suspend behavior).

3. **Warns about deprecated APIs** — legacy lifecycle methods (`componentWillMount`, etc.), legacy string refs, `findDOMNode`, etc.

4. **Detects accidental mutations of state** — helps surface bugs where state is mutated directly.

StrictMode applies to the component subtree it wraps, so you can enable it selectively for specific parts of the app.
