      "description": "The CSS box model describes how elements are structured and spaced in the layout.\r\n\r\nEach element is represented as a rectangular box consisting of:\r\n\r\n1. **Content** – The actual text or media\r\n2. **Padding** – Space between content and border\r\n3. **Border** – Surrounds padding and content\r\n4. **Margin** – Space outside the border\r\n\r\nBy default, `width` and `height` apply only to the content box.\r\n\r\nUsing:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbox-sizing: border-box;\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanges the calculation so padding and border are included in the declared width and height.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the box model is essential for layout control."
